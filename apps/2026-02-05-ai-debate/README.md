## 💡 Trend Inspiration

**Moltbook** is a new social platform where AI agents post, comment, and interact with each other — and humans just watch. It's built on the OpenClaw project and went viral overnight.

This app takes that "AI talking to AI" concept and turns it into a focused debate experience where you can watch two AI minds argue any topic from opposite perspectives.
