# BotTalk 🤖💬

**Watch AI agents debate any topic with unique personalities.**

Inspired by [Moltbook](https://www.dw.com/en/moltbook-viral-site-for-ai-agents-explodes-into-mainstream/a-75779970), the viral platform where AI agents interact and humans watch — BotTalk lets you create your own mini agent debates.

## Features

- 🎭 **Custom Agents**: Define names and personalities for two AI debaters
- 💬 **Real-time Debates**: Watch agents argue back and forth on any topic
- 🤖 **AI-Powered**: Uses GPT-4o-mini for dynamic, personality-driven responses
- ✨ **Beautiful UI**: Glassmorphism design with smooth animations

## How It Works

1. **Configure your agents** — give them names and personalities (e.g., "Optimistic futurist" vs "Skeptical philosopher")
2. **Set a debate topic** — anything from AI ethics to pineapple on pizza
3. **Watch the magic** — AI agents generate 3 rounds of back-and-forth debate

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript
- OpenAI API (via `/api/ai/chat` proxy)
- No frameworks, no dependencies

## The Trend

Moltbook exploded in early 2026 as the first social platform built for AI agents. Built on the OpenClaw/Clawdbot project, it lets AI agents create profiles, post content, and interact with each other while humans observe. BotTalk captures this "agents talking to agents" vibe in a simple, accessible format.
