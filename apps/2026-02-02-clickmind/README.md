**Can AI predict where you'll click next?**

A psychological game where AI analyzes your click patterns and attempts to predict your next move in a 3x3 grid.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click on any cell in the 3x3 grid
2. After 3 clicks, the AI starts predicting your next move
3. Try to be unpredictable and beat the AI!
4. Watch as the AI learns your patterns and gets smarter

## 🤖 How It Works

The AI uses GPT-4o-mini to analyze:
- Your click history
- Frequency patterns (most/least clicked cells)
- Sequential patterns (common move sequences)
- Human psychological tendencies (avoiding repetition, position preferences)

Based on this analysis, it predicts where you'll click next. Can you outsmart it?
