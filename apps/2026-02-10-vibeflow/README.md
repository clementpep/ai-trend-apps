# VibeFlow 🌊

**Focus space for vibe coding** — A minimalist workspace to enhance your AI coding prompts, stay focused with a pomodoro timer, and immerse yourself in ambient sounds.

## 🎯 Trend Inspiration

**Vibe Coding** is the hottest trend in developer productivity right now. Instead of writing every line manually, developers describe what they want and let AI generate the code. This workflow shift demands better prompt engineering skills.
