# ⚔️ AI Debate Arena

> Two AI personalities debate any topic you choose.

## 🎯 Trend Inspiration

Inspired by the viral trend of **AI agents communicating with each other** (see: OpenClaw/Moltbot going viral, HindustanTimes article on "AI agents have found each other"). This app visualizes what happens when two AI minds with different reasoning styles clash on a topic.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Enter any debate topic** (or pick a suggestion)
2. **Watch two AI personas battle it out:**
   - **LOGOS** 🧠 (The Analyst) — argues with data, logic, and structured reasoning
   - **PATHOS** 🎨 (The Visionary) — argues with emotion, ethics, and imagination
3. **3 rounds of back-and-forth** — each AI responds to the other
4. **Form your own opinion** — the best debates expand thinking, not declare winners

## 🤖 AI-Powered

Uses the hub's AI API (`/api/ai/chat`) with `gpt-4o-mini` to generate real-time debate responses. Each persona has a distinct system prompt that shapes their argumentative style.

## 🎨 Features

- ✨ Real-time typewriter effect for speeches
- 🎯 Suggestion chips for quick topic ideas
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🌙 Dark glassmorphism UI
- 💬 Maintains debate history for contextual responses
