- 🎭 **Animated elements** — Float, pulse, spin, twinkle effects
- 📐 **Depth layers** — 3-layer composition for realistic depth
- 🚀 **Instant fallback** — Local generation when offline

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Canvas API for particle effects
- AI API (gpt-4o-mini) for intelligent scene parsing
- CSS animations for element effects

## Example Prompts

- "A cozy cabin in the snow with smoke rising from the chimney"
